You've returned to the place where you met Phantom...
You see a black silhouette in the back... Is it?

???; Hey there, I'm zanagi, the developer of this game.
zanagi; Thank you so much for playing this game :)
zanagi; The reason I'm here instead of Phantom and something of a final boss fight is...
zanagi; That I'm a slowpoke and I couldn't make the fight in time...
zanagi; My sincerest apologies for that and all the other missing content...
zanagi; I'll leave this Phantom here congratulating you for completing the game.
zanagi; Thanks again for playing.

Phantom; Now go, and live a better life this time.
